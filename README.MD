**Adversary use of Artifical Intelligence and LLMs and Classification of TTPs**

This Github is an attempt to organize known use of artificial intelligence by cyber threat actors and to map and track those techniques. In this scenario, we are focusing on cyber threat attacks that are being facilitated in some way by threat actors using artificial intelligence. This does not include political influence campaigns or mis/dis/mal information campaigns. It does include some fraud related cases, but I attempt to keep the focus on fraud activities that we would see in traditional campaigns but enhanced with AI.

It is worth specifically stating that in many cases defenders cannot confirm whether a threat actor used AI unless: (a) the reporting organization is looking at the use of their own AI tools such as Microsoft and OpenAI's reporting or (b) the actor decides to use AI tools available on the already-compromised endpoint. For this reason many reports on attacks or campaigns using AI are, when you read carefully, actually done by researchers. For this reason, I am remaining focused in this project *only* on what confirmed reports we have on threat actor's actual use.

Through this research it also became clear to me that there is not always an easy 1:1 mapping of the MITRE ATT&CK TTPs to this activity, and some are also not in the MITRE ATLAS project either (which focuses more on attacks on LLMs). For this reason, this project also attempts to build off of Microsoft and OpenAI's classification of LLM TTPs, to provide better means of describing this activity. [See Appendix A for this list](https://github.com/cybershujin/Threat-Actors-use-of-Artifical-Intelligence#appendix-a-llm-themed-ttps)

There have been relatively few individuals on criminal forums (Breachedforums[.]vc, Exploit[.]in or XSS) and telegrams actively discussing generative AI use. Some users have marketed alleged generative AI tools used for malicious purposes. See [Dark LLMs and Blackhat GPTs](https://github.com/cybershujin/Threat-Actors-use-of-Artifical-Intelligence/blob/main/Dark%20LLMs%20and%20Malicious%20AIs.MD). It is worth considering that that more technically capable and sophisticated actors are more likely to harness these types of tools. That said, there are only a small set of examples of alleged LLM outputs from these, and no posts provided evidence that LLM output was successfully used for an attack.

There has been secondary effect studies such as the significant increase observed in phishing since ChatGPT became widely available, reported as 1,265% increase between November 2022 to Jan 2023 by [SlashNext](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/slashnexts-2023-state-of-phishing-report-reveals-a-1-265-increase-in-phishing-emails-since-the-launch-of-chatgpt-in-november-2022--signaling-a-new-era-of-cybercrime-fueled-by-generative-ai-301971557.html). However, Slashnext and many other reports authored in this area are from vendors offering solutions in these security spaces and thus should be examined accordingly for bias.

[Update 5/14/2024] I wanted to call out some excellent reporting by [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/gb/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/back-to-the-hype-an-update-on-how-cybercriminals-are-using-genai) which covers a lot of the concepts things in both of my pages, though less indepth. Their findings are:<br><br>
- Adoption rates of AI technologies among criminals lag behind the rates of their industry counterparts because of the evolving nature of cybercrime.
- Compared to last year, criminals seem to have abandoned any attempt at training real criminal large language models (LLMs). Instead, they are jailbreaking existing ones.
- We are finally seeing the emergence of actual criminal deepfake services, with some bypassing user verification used in financial services.
<br><br>

[Update 5/15/2024] [Verizon DBIR report for 2024](https://github.com/cybershujin/Threat-Actors-use-of-Artifical-Intelligence/blob/main/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf) has a small, but well analyzed section about threat actor interest in AI:<br><br>
- Text analysis of criminal forums regarding AI alongside terms such as malware, phishing and vulnerability shows very little interest, and in fact most posts are about selling account access
- Phishing, malware and ransomware effectiveness analysis indicates there is not a pressing need for AI to be sucessful as a malicious actor
- The one large advancement that appears to be leveraged by threat actors is the use of deep fake technology

Generally speaking, most popular and widely accessible AIs and LLMs have significant safeguards so they are designed not to add or enable malicious or criminal activities. However, this requires "jailbreaking" or otherwise "attacking" the AI/LLM itself which is not covered here, but is on my [other repo](https://github.com/cybershujin/AI-and-ML-for-Cybersecurity).

**Scope**

This is not for:

• Threat actors attacking AI / ML / LLMs

• Researchers attacking or finding exploits or possible uses AI by threat actors

• Mis/dis/mal information campaigns using Deepfake technology

• Threats to AI users, or AI researchers For those items, some of it is in my other repo here [AI and ML for Cybersecurity](https://github.com/cybershujin/AI-and-ML-for-Cybersecurity) along with some tools for cybersecurity professionals.

These these are taken from reports listed on the [Sources page](https://github.com/cybershujin/Threat-Actors-Use-of-Artifical-Intelligence/blob/main/Sources.md) but the TTP mapping is an effort by me to map to the closest possible MITRE ATT&CK technique used. If you find an entry and believe a better TTP mapping is available, please contact me and/or comment.

During this incident,  INDRIK SPIDER exfiltrated credentials from cloud-based credential manager  Azure Key Vault. Logs show that INDRIK SPIDER also visited ChatGPT while  interacting with the Azure Portal. In addition to visiting ChatGPT while  browsing the Azure Portal — presumably to understand how to navigate in Azure  — browsing activity analysis indicates INDRIK SPIDER used search engines such  as Google and Bing and searched on GitHub during the operations to understand  how to exfiltrate Azure Key Vault credentials. Using search engines and  visiting ChatGPT indicate that though INDRIK SPIDER is likely new to the  cloud and not yet sophisticated in this domain, it is using generative AI to  fill these knowledge gaps.
